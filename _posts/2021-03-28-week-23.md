This week concludes our work on the Care Quality Dashboard project as part of University College London's Industry Exchange Network (UCL IXN). We thank everyone involved: our great team, our client, our users, and our supervisors. It was an amazing experience and we believe we've built a very useful platform that can hopefully be taken forward in the future.

As of today our code has been handed over to our client, all the UCL deliverables have been submitted including the project website, case study, individual reports, videos and of course this blog.

You can find the project website [here](https://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2020/group20/).

You can find the project's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team20).

A short 2-page case study can be found here, and our draft research paper is available here.
